# Recreating Amie.so animations with framer motion

**NOTE:** I am NOT affiliated with [Amie](https://amie.so/), but just really like their website, and think rebuilding this with Tailwind and Framer Motion can teach a lot to people. All of the images in `/public/` are owned by Amie, they are only used as teaching material here.
